# AHMI
AHMI is a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) based contact tracing mobile-App allowing the identification of the COVID-19 contagion degeneration tree in an early stage. A risk factor based on several data entries is calculated and assigned to each saved proximity interaction between users. AHMI is offered to governments and communities to get their 3T strategy (Test, Track and Treat) more efficient. [Website: https://www.ahmi.tn/]
